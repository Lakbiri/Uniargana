                <h2>Argan Oil :</h2>

                <p>Argan oil has a worldwide reputation for its beauty and health benefits. Discover the origin of this magic oil and its various uses.

                Argan oil is extracted from the fines removed from the argan nuts. However, the argan tree is found only in Morocco (especially the south-west), so it is said that the argan tree is endemic to Morocco.
                The argan tree grows alone in the arid and semi-arid regions of Morocco, it is found in Agadir, Essaouira, Tafraout and Taroudant. It is a very heat resistant tree, it can withstand even a temperature of 50 ° C, and survives in difficult dry conditions. Moreover, he can live up to 200 years.

                Statistics show that more than 800,000 hectares are planted with argan trees, but there is a significant annual loss of argan trees of 600 hectares. As for the annual production, it varies between 2500 and 4000 tons. The height of an argan tree can reach ten meters, and it produces between 10 and 30kg of fruits. However, a fine is 55% oil, and it takes nearly 38 kg of fruit (more than a tree) to extract a liter of argan oil. Which explains its high cost!

                <h3>Specificities:</h3>
                
                <p>
                Indeed, there is a distinction between the argan oil food that is obtained from the roasted amendons and the cosmetic oil obtained without going through roasting. It's easy to differentiate between the two oils:

Culinary argan oil has a darker color, a stronger taste and is more fragrant. It is widely used in cooking in different preparations and recipes, such as the delicious Amlou which is a paste of crushed almonds, argan oil and honey. But be careful, argan oil is also used to season salads.
Cosmetic argan oil is characterized by a lighter color and a very light odor. Cosmetic argan oil is used for skin, hair and angles. It has a lot of virtues and the biggest cosmetics brands today boast of their high-end argan products based on argan oil Morocco!

The extraction of argan oil requires a large amount of amendons and a lot of work and time. That's why its price is expensive. The price of Argan in Morocco can reach 600 MAD, while it goes up to 200 € in Europe.

                <h3>Composition:</h3>
                
                <p>
                    Argan oil is very rich in nutrients. It is particularly rich in fatty acids:

             - Mono unsaturated oleic acid (omega 9): 43%.

             - Polyunsaturated linoleic acid (omega 6): 36%.

Here is also the content of other elements for each 100g of argan oil: 48mg of tocopherols, 31mg of squalene, 300mg of carotene, 160mg of sterols and 5.6mg of polyphenols. All these elements give it several dietary and cosmetic properties
